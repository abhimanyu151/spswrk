		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, everyone:<br />For mantra japa I need to understand how &quot;Surya&quot; is pronounced exactly. Should we say Suu-r-ya or Suu-ri-ya? The former is like allure in English, while the latter is like Ri-o in English name. I thought the former is right, but HOW COME it&#039;s often translated(by pronounciation) as &quot;åˆ©&quot;, which should be pronounced as li or ri in Chinese? Same doubt as murti(image of a deity). I know &quot;r&quot; in Sanskrit can be read as &quot;ri&quot;, but that&#039;s when there&#039;s a dot below the letter, isn&#039;t it? I looked it up in a dictionary and found that there&#039;s no dot below the &quot;r&quot; in Surya. Why is this? There are so many difficulties for a Chinese to learn Sanskrit and this is just one of them...</p>]]></content>
