		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p><p>I&#039;m looking to translate a phrase from Ralph Waldo Emerson&#039;s essay &#039;Self Reliance.&#039;<br />In latin, the quote reads: &quot;Ne te quaesiveris extra.&quot;<br />Literally this translates, &quot;do not seek outside yourself.&quot; or translated contextually &quot;seek within.&quot;</p><p>Prefacing this request by disclosing that I don&#039;t have a great understanding of how spoken or written sanscrit works in terms of grammar.&#160; Particularly when translating from english, or latin for that matter.&#160; I do understand that sanskrit &#039;words&#039; can be matched against the translated phrase in the same order for a direct transliteration.&#160; However, I am trying to avoid a translation that will read awkwardly if a native speaker were to read it.</p><p>Using some of the translation tools, I have worked out these bits:</p><p>Seek within:&#160; मार्गति नि (verb adverb, per this sites dictionary)<br />Do not seek outside yourself:&#160; दो नोत सीक ओउत्सिदे यौर्सेल्फ़ (straight translation from <a href="http://www.tamilcube.com/translate/sanskrit.aspx)">http://www.tamilcube.com/translate/sanskrit.aspx)</a></p><p>My question is, given my objective of not obtaining an awkwardly transliterated phrase, which is the best way to write the phrase?&#160; If there is a better way to write it that makes sense from the perspective of a native reader or speaker, I would prefer that route.&#160; Regardless, I can&#039;t read it, but I think the script is beautiful, and would want to honor it by getting the properly translated phrase (in case i ran across someone who does know how to read it (I dont want to look stupid :-) ).</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p><p>Greg</p>]]></content>
