		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi!</p><p>I&#039;m writing fantasy books/short stories as a hobby, and since I try to do things accurate, I spend most of the time doing research. Lately, I&#039;m planning to have a (magical) artifact turn up in one of my stories, which comes from the distant past of a land that corresponds to india in the fantasy-world where the story plays.</p><p>Now, I wanted to have a nice and mysterious name for this artifact, since a decent amount of time will have to be spent by the characters in the story to find out what it does. Hence, I decided to have a sanskrit name, which of course has to be related to what it does. Here&#039;s the description:</p><p>The &quot;artifact&quot; is some kind of strange-looking jewellry, two silvery, curved pieces of metal with lots of ornaments and strange symbols on them, each approximately the size of a finger.<br />The two pieces are actually eye-brow jewellry, that can be magically glued to one&#039;s forehead (right above the eyebrows) when wettened by spittle.<br />Once the bearer wears them, he or she has to be very careful when blinking his or her eyes: every time he or she closes and re-opens eyes, on re-opening them he/she will be teleported to the place that was in the focus of his or her stare when closing the eyes.<br />Within the fantasy world, this is explained to be loosely connected to time magic, but not worked out in full detail (it&#039;s a fantasy world, remember). </p><p>Now I&#039;m looking for a nice sanskrit name for this artifact. I thought about something like &quot;half moons of time&quot; (due to the shape and way they work), but anything else loosely connected will also work (&quot;half moons of speed&quot;? &quot;eye brows of reflection&quot;? &quot;moon shards&quot;?).</p><p>I will greatly appreciate any suggestions and translations.</p><p>Regards,<br />lightandshadow</p><p>PS: A short note: Since I will use LaTeX to typeset the whole thing, the correct LaTeX code for the name would be superb!</p>]]></content>
