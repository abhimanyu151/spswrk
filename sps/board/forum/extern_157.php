The whole set of sandhi rules are tailored around anatomy of human mouth and its muscle movements. All that was done so that the knowledge is transmitted by memorizing the scriptures and passing it on to next generation with proper pronunciation.</p><p>So change in pronunciation is treated as a defect and not as an acceptable &#039;feature&#039;.</p><p>That said, there are some slight regional differences in the way the how folks configure their mouths at the end of a word. [Except for words ending with visargaH, for which there is a rule] That is the only noticeable difference today. </p><p>Of course, unless you are observant you wont notice this difference. This diff. is not like Florida bayou accent that will be total gibberish to a New Englander! ]</p>]]></content>
