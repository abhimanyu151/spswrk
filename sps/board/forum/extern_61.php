		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for replying promptly. I checked Monier Williams and found the form, but he refers to the source as Rgveda. I will check Rgveda reference and its commentaries and revert back.</p><p>Just I said it would be non-Paninan or archaic in the general setup of Paninian Grammar. I hope you will understand Paninian Grammar. In classical literature, it is not possible to find. May be in archaic usages, but Monier Williams has noted the usage from Rgveda, but he hasn&#039;t given the reference.</p><p>To explain the Grammatical issue precisely, you should know the process of derivation of roots. There are Moods and Tenses according to western classification of Conjugation of Verbs. In Ardhadhaatuka moods, that is in the Moods and other derivative suffixes called &quot;Ardhadhaatuka&quot; suffixes, certain roots are substituted by others as their use with these were not noted by Paninian system. Such verbs are Bru - brUte - cannot take causative as braavayati, but Vaacayati. In the same way, caShTe - causative could not be cakShayati. In spite of archaic usages.</p><br /><p>Thanks once again for pointing out to your source.</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have a very deep understanding of the subject and I&#039;m honestly not able to follow your post in every detail. As far as I know, &quot;khyāpayati&quot; (I&#039;m using the IAST transliteration) is the third person singular causative of root &quot;khyā&quot; (class 2), meaning &quot;to announce&quot; or &quot;to declare&quot;, while &quot;vicakṣayati&quot; is the actual causative form of root &quot;vi-cakṣ&quot;. I&#039;m pretty sure of this, you can take a look at the online Monier Williams dictionary, you&#039;ll find &quot;vicakṣayati&quot; by entering &quot;vicakṣ&quot; in the proper textbox. Hope this helps.</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I saw one form CAUSATIVE from the root वि+चक्ष् = अदादिः, which is used in the Second Group of conjugation always. Meaning to explain. In causative and other primary derivations, it will take the substitutions ख्या or ख्शा, and ख्यापयति will be grammatically correct form in the Causative as per the rule &quot;चक्षिङः ख्याञ्&quot; (२. ४. ५५). Hence the dictionary entry :</p><p>&#160; &#160; विचक्षयति { वि- चक्ष् }&#160; &#160; vicakShayati { vi- cakSh }&#160; &#160; verb caus.&#160; &#160; explain</p><p>would be only ungrammatical. It should be व्याचष्टे in the simple form of the verb or the correct verb also आख्याति be acceptable. The only primary derivatives are the present participle: व्याचक्षाणः = one who explains. Other forms would be taken care of by ख्या. Even the common derivative विचक्षण is acceptable by its usage taking it as granted. If we want to take this relaxation, to विचक्षयति, it would ungrammatical and non-paninian usage. </p><p>Any other justification for the entry is most welcome.</p>]]></content>
